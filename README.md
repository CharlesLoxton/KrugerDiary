## Kruger Diary

This is a Fastify.js progressive web app that allows users to keep track of their journey through the Kruger National Park.
It only needs to be loaded once then it will run offline on your local device. It is fully integrated with [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) so that you can view your journey on a map. All data is stored locally using `IndexedDB`.

### Setup
1. Install Node.js
2. Clone the repo
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. You can now start logging your diary entries.
